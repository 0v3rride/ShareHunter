# ShareHunter.py
Finds smb/samba shares on the network as quickly or as slowly as you want.
* Requires Python 3 and pysmb. 
* At the moment, it works more efficiently with on Windows
* I'm trying to modify it so it works with the same efficiency on Linux as it does on Windows

### Why?
* Rapid7 screwed the smb_enumshares module with the latest update to MSF.
* Wanted to try something new.
